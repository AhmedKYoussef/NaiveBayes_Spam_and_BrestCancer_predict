This repo contains two notebooks the first one about how to use Naive bayes to predict the spam and not spam messages it's binary classification and use discrete data.


the second one about predict the breast cancer diagnosis and used continous data, also it's a binary classification problem.


**Notice**

You need to have [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and install sklearn, pandas and numpy to run it on your local machine or use [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

I didn't go into details of Naive bayes algorithm and just use skilrean to make it easy for beignners in Data scince to understand. Enjoy!!!
